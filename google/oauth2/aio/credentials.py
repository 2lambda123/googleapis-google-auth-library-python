"""OAuth 2.0 Asynchronous Credentials.

This module provides credentials based on OAuth 2.0 access and refresh tokens.
These credentials usually access resources on behalf of a user (resource
owner).

Specifically, this is intended to use access tokens acquired using the
`Authorization Code grant`_ and can refresh those tokens using a
optional `refresh token`_.

Obtaining the initial access and refresh token is outside of the scope of this
module. Consult `rfc6749 section 4.1`_ for complete details on the
Authorization Code grant flow.

.. _Authorization Code grant: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1
.. _refresh token: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6
.. _rfc6749 section 4.1: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1
